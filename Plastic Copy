Plastic is ubiquitous in the humanâ€™s day-to-day life. The thought of plastic might be a good idea during its start to have a wide range of characteristics and serving humanity to its maximum extent. Here, do every other creature on the planet knows about the usage of plastic or any waste generated by humans. It might be partially yes and no. Instances such as coconut-carrying octopus show that some creatures in nature do know in the usage of some waste generated by humans. Is it the same with the plastic, it might be no. This triggers me about the source of plastic all around the world ranging from deep seas to the atmosphere, is about the segregation and recycling. However, most of us know the usage of plastic but not much aware of different kinds of plastic and its recycling.
The thought here is to say Hi to the plastic (inclusive rather than simply an object) with a theme of seven days with seven different color-coding (V I B G Y O R).
-The end user of the plastic is individual if the segregation starts at the individual level, recycling of plastic might be much easier and results in the effective usage of plastic. In general, Plastics types are categorized into 7 different types so if the people know the which kind of the plastic they are using on a regular basis and bin them into suitable boxes, the cost can be greatly reduced and most of the plastic can be recycled in a more efficient manner.
