About Us

We are a fresh startup with a drive to disrupt the way we think about our consumption of plastic. People are aware of their calorie intake into their bodies, however how many people are aware of the effects of their habitual plastic usage? We want people to think about their use of plastic in the same way that they think about their consumption of food. We are not separate from our planet and we need a revolution of consciousness to forge the path towards a future where humans end up as a net positive for planet Earth.
